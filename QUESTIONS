Describe the contents of an IP packet and for each field describe the purpose it serves.

    1)  Version: of the protocol
    2)  IHL: how long the header will be
    3)  QoS: *******************************
    4)  Length: total length of the IP packet header & data inclusive
    5)  Identifier: unique identifiers for fragments of a single IP datagram
        such as flags and offset
    6)  TTL: How many hops the packet has left before a router drops it to
        prevent it from circulating forever
    7)  Protocol: The "Application Layer" protocol that sits above IP like TCP
    8)  Checksum: The value that indicates if the integrity of the IP Packet
        header is correct
    9)  Source IP: Sender's IP address
    10) Destination IP: Recipients IP Address
    11) Options: Generally not used, but can contain extras like timestamp
    12) Data: The higher level protocol header and associated data being sent
        through IP.

Describe the general operation of the BGP protocol.

    The Border Gateway Protocol serves to bridge the gap between various AS
    (Autonomous Systems). Different sections of the internet exist,

Describe why the ethernet protocol necessitates a minimum packet size.

    <your answer>

Describe how TCP reacts to congestion in the network.  Assume that
congestion is brought on by BGP reconfiguring the path such that TCP
packets now go through a bottleneck link of capacity B packets/second.
Describe in detail what TCP will do when faced with this bottleneck.

    <your answer>

Describe TCP's behavior when it is first getting started delivering data
over a high latency, high-bandwidth channel such as a satellite link. Be
sure to explain how TCP manages its window size during the initial
connection setup.

On an ethernet segment, the ARP protocol is used to locate the ethernet
address of a host whose IP address is known. On the Internet, DNS is
used to locate the IP address of a host whose name is known. ARP and
DNS are drastically different -- the former uses a broadcast mechanism
while the latter implements a scalable, distributed database. Explain
why DNS was designed the way it was, and not, for instance, based on
a simple broadcast.

Describe the two means by which a DNS name, such as www.cnn.com, is
resolved.

    <your answer>

What is a DNS local resolver?

What purpose does the ACK # serve in TCP?

    <your answer> * Provides the next byte of data that the other machine is waiting for

What purpose does the destination port number serve in UDP?

    <your answer> * sending to correct process

Why does UDP include a checksum? Wouldn't the end-to-end argument
require that all checksums be performed at the application level, and
hence argue that UDP and TCP elide such additional checksums in the
network stack?

    UDP doesn't care about details, but it does assure integrity.
    By performing a check at each stage, errors are caught sooner, increasing
    the efficiency of the protocol.

Imagine that a mail server on host A has just received a TCP/IP SYN
packet destined for it. Describe everything that happens to this packet
from the point of its reception by the network interface card to the
point of its delivery to the mail server.

In IPv6, why do routers not fragment packets? Then how does IPv6 deal with the issue
of Minimum Transmission Unit (MTU)?

    IPv6 routers do not fragment packets due to efficiency. It is far more
    efficient for the source to handle the resizing of the information. IPv6
    deals with MTUs in one of two ways:
        1) Use the default MTU of 1280 which all physical networks can handle.
        2) Use "Path MTU Discovery" - a node sends messages over the route it
        will use to determine how large it can make the packets.

What is the difference between a web proxy and a vpn? When would it be advantageous 
to use a proxy instead of a vpn?

    Proxy is better for keeping cost down. Proxies can also be used to fake
    locational data. A proxy simply acts as an intermediary for requests. A VPN
    is actually an encrypted virtual tunnel over the telecom structure, granting
    a user secure access. VPNs are also generally restricted to one computer per
    connection, where a proxy can support many.
